Designed to type / copy in an address from a computer on the same network, and have it open up on the server that's actually running it

My use case:
- i have a computer hooked up to the giant tv in the living room, and it's kind of a pain to type on it since i'm only using the steam controller
- i want to open 8tracks or something in chrome and see it on the big screen
